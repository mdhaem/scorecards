iscorecards
===========

Score our card games... Web App initially just Shanghai, but will be expanded to allow any card game.  

For the last few years we have been playing cards almost every Friday night whenever we and our cousins are in town. All this time we have keeped score using a stinografers pad. Its now full and time for a new one. Instead I elected to build a web application we could use on our iPhones. This app allows us to enter the score for each hand and tally results. At games end it will declare the winner and save the results to a database. One feature that we will enjoy is the presentation of life time winnings of each player. This app uses a database which is accesed through REST CardGame API.

The app is written in HTML 5, jquery, and javascript. The backend is PHP and MySql.

Have many todo's... however it is good enough to use for Shanghai while futher developlent happens.
